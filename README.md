# Home-Sweet-Home

Home-Sweet-Home is a text-based puzzle and adventure game set in the modern world. The player navigates a dynamically changing maze-like house, solves riddles, collects items, and delivers a specific item to a designated NPC to escape their gloomy fate.

This project was developed as part of a Software Engineering class. I handled all the coding work for the group, implementing the core game logic and a final polished version with all features fully functional.

Features

Dynamic Maze Gameplay: The game environment changes as you play, providing a fresh challenge each session.

Puzzle Solving: Solve riddles and complete tasks to progress.

Item Collection & Delivery: Find specific items and deliver them to the correct NPC to win.

Data-Driven Design: Key game information (e.g., room layouts, NPCs, items, and riddles) is stored in JSON files. This allows easy updates and scalability without modifying core logic.

Technology Stack

Language: Java

File Handling: JSON parsing for game configuration
