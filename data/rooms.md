# Rooms Data File Documentation

## Overview
The `rooms.json` file defines all rooms in the game world, their descriptions, connections, and contained objects (items and NPCs). This file provides the structure for navigation and interactions within the game environment.

## File Structure
The file is a JSON array, where each object represents a **room** with the following fields:

### Fields

| `id`          | `string`  | Unique identifier for the room. |
| `name`        | `string`  | The display name of the room. |
| `longDesc`    | `string`  | A detailed description of the room when the player enters. |
| `shortDesc`   | `string`  | A brief description of the room when the player revisits. |
| `exits`       | `object`  | Defines available movement directions and their corresponding connected rooms. |
| `items`       | `array`   | A list of item IDs available in the room. |
| `npcs`        | `array`   | A list of NPC IDs currently present in the room. |

### Interacting with an NPC

]
```
**Game Output:**
